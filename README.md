# Liquid-v6.0
Liquid Application Framework - v6.0

# Develop and Run Liquid Modern Applications
Liquid is a **multi-cloud** framework designed to **accelerate the development** of cloud-native microservices while avoiding coupling your code to specific cloud providers. 

When writing Liquid applications, you stop worrying about the technology and focus on your business - Liquid abstracts most of the boilerplate and let you just write domain code that looks great and gets the job done.

# Forked from [Avanade's](https://github.com/ava-innersource/Liquid-Application-Framework-1.0-deprecated)
This version is a continuation (and an evolution) of v1.0 of the [original (now deprecated) Liquid Framework of Avanade](https://github.com/ava-innersource/Liquid-Application-Framework-1.0-deprecated), which decided to make an architectural rupture in v2.0 onwards, requiring a total rewrite of applications written in v1.0.

This fork, which jumps directly to version v6.0, in addition to making it easier to migrate applications written in v1.0, also upgrades them from .NET Core v2.2 to .NET v6.0.

Finally it brings other valuable improvements and additions.

## Features

- Abstracts a number of services from cloud providers such as Azure and Google Cloud to enable you to write code that will run anywhere.
- Brings a prescribed programming model that will save you time on thinking how to structure your application, allowing you to focus on writing business code.

# Getting Started

To use Liquid, you create a new base .NET Web API Application and install the following nuget packages:

- `LiquidApplication.Platform`

And then choose what implementation cartridge you need to run your environment:

- If you'll deploy your application to Azure, install `LiquidApplication.OnAzure`
- If you'll deploy your application to Google, install `LiquidApplication.OnGoogle`
